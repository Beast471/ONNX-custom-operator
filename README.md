# Finding image similarity using Pre-trained ResNet-18 model and implement a custom reduction operator in ONNX C++ 


## Steps to run  
After unzipping folder goto model.py file present in research folder which contains inference code.
Threre's no need to give any paths or additional input. 

But if one wants to run model for new dataset then there's need to change dataset path in model.py file.

## Directories
### Challenge images : 
This folder contains provided dataset.
### Inference :
This folder contains c++ code for reduction operator, setup file and builds.
### Libtorch:
This contains downloaded library files.
### models
Contains model exported to onnx format that can be viewed using Netron.
### research
Contains inference code and csv file containing result.
